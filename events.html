	<h2 class="section-title">Events & Conferences</h2>
	
	<p>If you're looking for resources and opportunities to help you along your career and/or academic path, you might want to consider attending a tech conference that is specifically geared towards women. Not only can these conferences be useful career-wise, but they can also be a great place to simply meet other women who are passionate about technology.<br><br></p>

	 	<h3 class='section-item-title'>Grace Hopper Conference (GHC)</h3>

	 	<p>GHC is the largest conference for women in computing in the world. Hundreds of companies like Google, IBM, and Microsoft sponsor the event and recruit new interns and employees at the four-day career fair. Although it typically costs $1,200 for a student ticket, several companies and organizations provide scholarships for students to attend the conference. So out of all the scholarships listed here, GHC is probably the most affordable!</p>
	 	<ul>
			<li>
				<p>The Math and CS department opens up a scholarship application at the end of every academic year (June) and selects four students from the department to attend at no cost. So be on the lookout for an email from Dr. Linnell at the end of the year! AWCM also offers scholarships sponsored by the Computer Science and Engineering Department.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The Anita Borg Organization, which organizes the conference itself, offers several student scholarships. The applications for these open up late January.
